# Context Management Patterns

**Purpose**: Patterns for managing context windows and memory in AI-assisted development.

**Status**: 🚧 Placeholder - Content to be developed

**Value**: Optimized memory usage and attention focusing

---

## Overview

Context management patterns help AI coding assistants:
- Stay within context window limits
- Maintain relevant information
- Focus attention on important details
- Use memory efficiently

---

## Planned Content

### Context Windows
Managing context limits:
- When to summarize
- What to keep in context
- How to structure context efficiently
- Strategies for large codebases

### Summarization
Summarization strategies:
- When to summarize vs. keep full context
- What information to preserve
- Progressive summarization
- Summary quality validation

### Memory Tiers
Short-term vs long-term memory:
- Session memory (immediate context)
- Working memory (current task)
- Long-term memory (project knowledge)
- When to move between tiers

### Attention Shaping
Focusing attention:
- Highlighting important information
- Structuring for relevance
- Managing competing priorities
- Attention budget allocation
