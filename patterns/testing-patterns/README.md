# Testing Patterns

**Purpose**: Testing strategies and patterns for AI-assisted development.

**Status**: 🚧 Placeholder - Content to be developed

**Value**: Comprehensive test coverage, zero pollution, efficient testing

---

## Overview

Testing patterns for AI-assisted development:
- Test-driven development with AI
- Automated testing strategies
- Coverage optimization
- Integration testing approaches
- Test isolation and cleanup

---

## Planned Content

### Test-Driven Development
TDD patterns with AI assistants:
- Writing tests before implementation
- Test case generation
- Coverage-driven development
- Refactoring with test safety net

### Testing Automation
Automation strategies:
- CI/CD integration
- Automated test generation
- Regression test suites
- Performance testing

### Coverage Optimization
Achieving comprehensive coverage:
- Coverage goals and metrics
- Edge case identification
- Missing coverage detection
- Coverage-guided development

### Integration Testing
Integration test approaches:
- Service integration patterns
- Database integration tests
- API testing strategies
- End-to-end testing

### Test Isolation
Preventing test pollution:
- Mock vs. real dependencies
- Test data management
- Cleanup strategies
- Test environment isolation

## Development Notes

This pattern category needs to be developed based on:
- The Symposium testing (81 tests, 100% pass rate)
- Zero production data pollution
- Mock strategies for OpenSearch/Redis
- Integration test patterns

**Important**: This content may overlap with `core-rules/testing/`. The harmonize-content worker will need to:
1. Identify overlapping content
2. Determine canonical location
3. Cross-reference appropriately
4. Eliminate redundancy

**Target content**:
- Practical testing patterns
- Mock creation strategies
- Test isolation techniques
- Coverage optimization approaches
- Real examples from The Symposium

**Key Achievements to Document**:
- 81 tests created with AI assistance
- 100% pass rate
- Zero production data pollution
- Effective mock strategies
- Isolated test environments
