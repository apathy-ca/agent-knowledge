# Git Workflow Patterns

**Purpose**: Git discipline and version control patterns for AI-assisted development.

**Status**: 🚧 Placeholder - Content to be developed

**Value**: Consistent version control practices, clean history

---

## Overview

Git workflow patterns ensure:
- Clean commit history
- Proper documentation sync
- Effective collaboration
- Recoverable changes

---

## Planned Content

### Branch Strategies
Branching patterns for AI-assisted development:
- Feature branches
- Development workflows
- Integration patterns
- Branch naming conventions

### Commit Patterns
Commit message and organization:
- Commit frequency
- Message standards
- Atomic commits
- Documentation sync

### PR Workflows
Pull request workflows:
- PR creation patterns
- Review requirements
- Automated checks
- Merge strategies

### Conflict Resolution
Handling merge conflicts:
- Prevention strategies
- Resolution patterns
- Testing after merge
- Communication practices

## Development Notes

This pattern category needs to be developed based on:
- The Symposium's git discipline
- Multi-worker coordination (Czarina)
- Documentation sync patterns
- Version control at scale

**Important**: This content may overlap with `core-rules/workflows/git-workflows.md`. The harmonize-content worker will need to:
1. Identify overlapping content
2. Determine canonical location
3. Cross-reference appropriately
4. Eliminate redundancy

**Target content**:
- Practical git patterns for AI development
- Commit message templates
- Branch strategy examples
- Conflict resolution workflows
