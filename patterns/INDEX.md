# Patterns Index

Battle-tested patterns with quantified impact from real projects.

**What are Patterns?** Proven strategies that show **how** to implement requirements effectively.

**How do they relate to Core Rules?** [Core Rules](../core-rules/INDEX.md) define what you must do; Patterns show how to do it well.

## Relationship to Core Rules

### Patterns vs. Core Rules

**Patterns** show **HOW**:
- Proven strategies from real projects
- Real-world examples with code
- Quantified impact metrics
- Trade-offs and alternatives

**Core Rules** define **WHAT**:
- Standards and requirements
- Role definitions
- Quality criteria
- Workflow structures

### Example: Error Handling

**Core Rule:** [Error Handling](../core-rules/python-standards/ERROR_HANDLING.md)
- Defines WHAT: Use specific exceptions, log errors, handle failures properly

**Pattern:** [Error Recovery](./error-recovery/)
- Shows HOW: Retry with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, fallback strategies
- Provides evidence: 30-50% reduction in debugging time
